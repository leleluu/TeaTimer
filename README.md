# Tea Timer - v2
The goal of this project was to recreate and finish my first ever iOS app - a tea timer to ensure the perfect brew ‚ò∫Ô∏è üçµ!  
As I learn best when tinkering, I did not spend too much time on design or user experience here, but instead used this to play around with Apple's core frameworks.

- Add/remove tea from your tea collection
- Assign a colour to your tea 
- Start, pause or reset countdown timer
